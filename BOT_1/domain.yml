          - Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are dedicated courts set up by State Governments in consultation with the concerned High Courts to ensure swift dispensation of justice.
          - They have a specific jurisdiction, which can limit their ability to deal with related cases.
          Case Allocation
          - FTSCs handle cases of heinous crimes, civil cases related to women, children, senior citizens, HIV/AIDS, and other designated categories.
          - Cases are allocated to FTSCs by the High Court or the State Government.
          Procedure
          - The judge will expect cooperation between the parties (plaintiff and defendant) to complete the allocation process.
          - A listing questionnaire (Form N170) is sent to the parties, which they must return to the court by a specified date, along with the appropriate fee.
          - A copy of the questionnaire should be sent to the opposing party.
          - If additional information is required, the court will issue an order (Form N156) specifying what information is needed and the deadline for its submission.
          Trial and Disposal
          - FTSCs aim to dispose of cases within a year.
          - They have a better clearance rate compared to regular courts, with speedy trials being a key feature.
          Performance
          - As of May 2024, 866 FTSCs are functional across the country.
          - While some States have made progress in disposing of cases, others still lag behind the target of completing cases within a year.
